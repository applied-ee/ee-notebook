# Integrated Circuits as Layer-Spanning Artifacts

## What This Section Covers

- **[ICs Are Not an Abstraction Level]({{< relref "ics-are-not-an-abstraction-level" >}})** — Why integrated circuits don't fit neatly into the primitive–block–subsystem hierarchy, and what that means for reasoning about them.

- **[Collapsed Subsystems]({{< relref "collapsed-subsystems" >}})** — How ICs compress multiple abstraction levels into a single package, and the consequences for understanding their behavior.

- **[What You Can and Can't Treat as a Black Box]({{< relref "black-box-boundaries" >}})** — When the datasheet abstraction is sufficient, and when you need to reason about what's inside.

- **[Why External Components Still Matter]({{< relref "why-external-components-still-matter" >}})** — How the components surrounding an IC shape its behavior, and why "integrated" doesn't mean "self-contained."
