# System-Level Thinking

## What This Section Covers

- **[Systems as Coordination Problems]({{< relref "systems-as-coordination-problems" >}})** — Why system-level failures are usually about interactions between correctly-functioning parts, not about any single broken component.

- **[Environmental and Human Inputs]({{< relref "environmental-and-human-inputs" >}})** — How temperature, vibration, power quality, user behavior, and other external factors become part of the system whether or not the design accounts for them.

- **[Why Bench-Stable Designs Fail in Systems]({{< relref "why-bench-stable-designs-fail" >}})** — The gap between controlled bench conditions and real operating environments, and the failure modes that only appear in deployment.

- **[Observability Limits at System Scale]({{< relref "observability-limits" >}})** — Why you can't probe everything, why system-level symptoms are often indirect, and how to debug when direct measurement isn't possible.
