# Composition Patterns

## What This Section Covers

- **[From Primitive to Block]({{< relref "from-primitive-to-block" >}})** — How individual components combine into functional circuits with coherent purpose.

- **[From Block to Subsystem]({{< relref "from-block-to-subsystem" >}})** — How functional blocks compose into subsystems with defined specifications.

- **[From Subsystem to Device]({{< relref "from-subsystem-to-device" >}})** — How subsystems integrate into self-contained devices with external interfaces.

- **[Interfaces Between Layers]({{< relref "interfaces-between-layers" >}})** — The four channels — power, signal, time, and control — that connect abstraction levels and define the contracts between them.
