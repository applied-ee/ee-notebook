# Practical Mental Models

## What This Section Covers

- **[Energy, Information, Time, and Control]({{< relref "energy-information-time-and-control" >}})** — Four orthogonal lenses for reasoning about any circuit or system, and how each reveals different aspects of behavior and failure.

- **[Healthy vs Broken at Each Layer]({{< relref "healthy-vs-broken-at-each-layer" >}})** — What "working correctly" looks like at each abstraction level, and the characteristic signatures of failure at each one.

- **[Abstraction Smells]({{< relref "abstraction-smells" >}})** — Patterns that suggest you're using the wrong abstraction, relying on a broken one, or missing a level entirely.

- **[Designing for Debuggability]({{< relref "designing-for-debuggability" >}})** — How architectural choices made during design determine whether a circuit can be diagnosed efficiently when it fails.
